DATA ANALYTICS POTFOLIO
Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I am a data analyst with experience in using various tools and technologies to collect, organize, and analyze data to inform business decisions. I am proficient in SQL, Excel, and Tableau, and have a solid understanding of Python and data analytics techniques such as dashboard building, report writing, data mining, data merging, statistics, and critical thinking.

In this portfolio, I have included some of my projects that showcase my data analytics skills, My first project uses SQL to find out how many NBA players come from each country and how many players at each position are from each countries using data from an excel sheet, my second  project uses SQL to find out what supplements are most effective for lifting, sports, or even both, through data collected on an excel, my third project uses SQL to collect data from a bike company to find the conditions of sales activities within the company

I am confident that my data analytics skills make me an ideal candidate for any data analyst role, and I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.
